            <p>All right. Welcome everyone. Thank you for joining the Founders Leadership Panel for AgD2 Advisors, where deep advisor experience meets your team's needs for your startup company growth. So if you're an AgTech startup or an AgBio startup, navigating that critical path from seed funding to venture capital, you're in the right place. I'm Hugh Young, business development lead for AgD2. And I'm excited to introduce our three founding partners today, all our season industry experts who bring decades of insight from R&D, commercialization, regulatory strategy, and startup investor readiness. So AgD2 was created with one major goal to help AgTech startups accelerate that journey from early stage promise to venture capital-backed growth. So let's meet the team behind AgD2. We'll start the discussion today with brief introductions from the founding partners. We're joined today with Nick Macross, Kelly Smith, and John Samarron. Would each of you give our audience a quick snapshot of your career and what experience you bring to the AgTech startup community? Nick, we'll start with you. Hi, everyone. I'm Nick Macross. I have a Master's in Chemical Engineering and an MBA as far as training. I started my career off as an engineer at 3M. But after my MBA, I ended up moving to the US, work for Roman Haas, and literally got immersed at that point in 1999 and biopesticized. And that's really what I've been in. AgBiological is for the last 25 or so years. Most of my expertise is in classical business development, licensing, negotiation, text transfer, financial modeling, some cost of goods modeling, pitch deck, creation and review, and some manufacturing leadership. And I've been directly working for 10 startups. It's been my space exclusively. So it gives me a unique perspective. So I've been on at the table where investors are looking at asking very tough questions. And I've been part of the team, hashed to really close those gaps. That's my perspective that I bring to the table for startups that are watching this. Perfect. Thank you, Nick. Excellent. Kelly? Hi, I'm Kelly Smith. My background is also in chemical engineering. I've a bachelor's in chemical engineering and a PhD in environmental engineering and environmental microbiology. I've spent most of my career working in the ag industry on agBiologicals, primarily biopesticides. I started a biopesticide company and commercialized a product and then sold the company to Sinjenta back in 2012. And since then, I've worked for several other startups, again, mostly in the agBiological space. I have a lot of background in building teams and fundraising, IP and R&D strategy for startups and just really like to help out companies that are just growing up in that space. John? Hi, I'm John Summerung. My background is in plant molecular genetics and genomics. I spent 16 years with Sinjenta and forming and managing a variety of research teams and also going on to project management, managing portfolios of early stage projects. Then I moved on and worked for a couple small to midsize companies and for the last seven years have advised early stage startup companies in all different kinds of agricultural technology. So I bring experience working in quite a diverse set of environments and also bring a very deep network built over a few decades that I tap into regularly for my clients. My passion is to see early stage ag's tech startup succeed and have their science be translated into benefits for farmers and the industry. So happy to work with you. Great, thank you all. So we'll start with the light one. What's in a name? Could you tell us what the meaning is sort of behind AGD2? Advisors is a logo. And Nick, I'll throw this one at you. What does AGD2 mean as a name? Okay. Well, AGD2 is really an acronym of two acronyms. So AG meaning agriculture and D2 is due diligence. So AGD2 was a real concise way of combining the two concepts and the idea is that it's a specialized advisory for agricultural startups and doing due diligence, advisory meaning thorough help for the startups from financial revenue forecast, cost of goods modeling, kind of everything that would be somebody like an investor would be looking at in a thorough due diligence. That's where the name comes from. So combine acronym. Perfect, perfect. All right, well, let's start with a broader question. Why did you all decide to start AGD2 and why now? Kelly, can I bring that to you first? Sure, we had all three of us been in touch from different parts of our careers and talking about consulting in this industry and seeing that there was a need in a lot of different companies for consulting specifically around this kind of due diligence work. So one of our slogans is we make you investor ready and that's the approach that we try to take to it and the need that we perceive, which was a lot of startup founders have great technology, they have a good team, they have a lot of stuff going for them but they don't have any idea really how to translate that into something that an investor is going to want to spend money on. They need to be able to talk about their technology and show the business that's going to grow out of that convincingly to an investor so that the investor will be willing to take a chance on them and we all just saw that there was a need for that in many of the companies that we were already doing consulting for. All right. Any others to add to around that? Yeah, yeah, so my answer is right now, startups in this segment, Agtech startups are facing the most difficult conditions that I can remember in a long time as far as the financial environment around funding and the regulatory environment that keeps also changing. There's a lot to deal with now with that Agtech startups have to deal with more than in the past. There is some incredible science being incubated in these companies. No question about that. But the startups tend to have trouble not then on the technical front but because of gaps in strategy of going to market, regulatory clarity and alignment with investors as far as what investors are looking for to support these companies. So AgD2's really core is to help companies bridge those gaps and be able to get to the next inflection point with a fully rounded proposition. And I had a few points. Yeah, go ahead. I think no single consultant really can provide what this group can provide because we also have an extended network of domain, like sub-tick matter experts. So we don't feel there's anything like this out there. And John touched on it. The industry is a lot more fickle now. When I got into biopesticized back in 1999, it was a little bit easier to navigate through investors withdrawing money at startups. Now the standard is a lot higher. The bar is higher. I think it's even more important and critical that startups get this kind of leadership in a turnkey manner. In a cheap manner too. But that was just additional, no single consultant. No one of us can do what we're doing as a team here collectively. On the first steps. Well, that segues in nicely, but I wanted to dive in to kind of what AgD2 actually offers. For each of you, what are some of the key areas that you believe these early stage ag tech companies have to get right before approaching an institutional investor, a VC investor? What are some of those things? Nick, we'll start with you. I'll start with the easy one. Pitchdeck is really your marketing material to a potential investor. A lot of startups don't have the background or the expertise or the time to do it right or to do the various areas that are required in the amount of detail that's required. So this team here has extensive experience in really quickly turning a pitch deck around so that it looks investor ready. You know, and there's a lot of aspects to pitch deck as the first thing comes to mind. John or Kelly? Yeah, and I would then follow up with regulatory. So, you know, rarely is a startup at this stage past regulatory hurdles. That's almost never had the case, but you at least have to have a roadmap of how to get there. You have to understand the steps it's gonna take, the cost is gonna take to get your product through the regulatory gauntlet. So we can help companies map that out and have a strategy to deliver on it. I think the other thing that Ag2, Ag2 provides is our collective network. I don't want to underestimate that. I think if I think about companies that I worked with in the past, my contributions to those companies have probably been as much value coming from people and organizations that I've connected those companies to then things I've done myself. And so that's one thing we can all do is fill in the gaps. Not everyone, not anyone, person or company can do everything. We can fill in the gaps and build you an extended team to get you where you need to go. Perfect. Kelly, did you think that? Yeah, I would build on that also by pointing out that we can help the startup show how they're going to achieve commercial traction. If they haven't done that already, help them show how they're going to get to a reasonable cost of goods for whatever it is that they're trying to produce. And one of my favorite things to do is actually to help a company map out an R&D to commercial strategy that will include an IP strategy, will include a regulatory strategy. And John's absolutely right that the regulatory piece of it is critical and that earlier you start mapping out your plan, your roadmap to get there is the better. And that's another thing that, you know, with the experience that we have and the other experts that we can bring in as the guys have pointed out, we really can help a startup show that to an investor in a way that, you know, maybe they don't know how to do by themselves. Perfect. We've touched on all these things in general, but one thing I will say, startups are often going to be very focused on the technical aspects of whatever problem they're looking to solve, whatever technical problems they're looking to solve. So in your minds, are there critical topics that you believe might be missed by some of these startup leaders, not by fault of their own, but simply because they're focused on proving their technology, are there things that come to mind that might be missed? Well, I would just say cost of goods. Yeah. That guy comes up all the time, every company that I have worked with, they need some help understanding how they're going to manufacture their product at a price that their desired customer wants to pay for it. Yeah, related to that. The competitive analysis, right? And I don't mean just comparing your company to another startup that's in the same area. The number one competitor for most new technologies is do nothing, meaning your customer is already doing something, right? They might be using a conventional chemical, for example. So you have to be aware of what is going to be the value proposition to them to switch because switching costs, they're switching costs. So that's my answer is being an awareness of what it's going to take for the customer to adopt your technology. Perfect. Think anything to add there on things that might just simply be missed by early stage startups. Yeah, all I had to sort of builds on with John said, we can help a lot of startups don't have the story, the compelling, what makes them distinctively different, what's compelling to an investor. We can help articulate that, what's their platform and is it something that is sellable as part of the value proposition. Another thing a lot of startups miss that makes it exciting for a possible investor is, well, what's next? They've got a pipeline, most startups, but they haven't thought maybe another couple steps forward, building, what could the next, what could the 10 years I'll look like leveraging their platform? Investors like to see that. Perfect. Yeah. When phrase that you often hear in the startup and investor world is de-risking. So I'm just curious if you guys wanted to expand on this. I know that the network, John, you're mentioning the deep network that this group has. Is that an aspect of de-risking for venture capitalists or for future investors? Just the knowledge that you all have as to what investors are looking for. How does that tie into de-risking for startup companies? It's a matter of thinking, being aware of the areas you need to de-risk and then coming up with a strategy to do that, right? And that could, in many cases, it could be going outside to find an either another expert or another organization that can do some work for you to de-risk something. Yeah. So it's really, de-risking is really awareness on them having a strategy and being resourceful about that strategy to eliminate those risks or mitigate them. Perfect. So let's talk really briefly how AGD2 actually engages with clients. What is your typical approach when working with an ag tech startup? Kelly, can I start with you? Sure. We, of course, just start with asking the customer what it is that they think their apps are. And then we will just try to understand what it is that they're trying to accomplish from there, right? Are they raising their seat or their series A round? Are they trying to figure out, you know, even who are the investors that I should be trying to pitch for this? You know, we can bring our network to bear on that kind of a question. And then we try to do some pretty intensive coaching, especially if it's a technical founder to help them understand how they're going to make this, make their pitch, make their case to the investor. Nick, anything to add there? Yeah, it varies depending on the client. It could be as simple as they come to us saying they want us to revamp their pitch deck, their financial model, or we go through like a secratic process where we're finding out, kind of little bits of information on their operation and we can make suggestions. It really is open-ended, but it could be some specific request from a client, or, you know, based on an initial discussion with our team, we could write, identify some areas that we could work together on. And it could be anything from a, you know, a small project that has a defined scope, or it could be a monthly, you know, type of arrangement where we are their fractional leadership team and really help them advise them on an ongoing basis and kind of everything in between. Perfect. But on anything to add on the nuts and bolts of how we interact. I think that Nick and I did a good job. Awesome. Awesome. So there are, and I think with those answers, we really sort of touched on this, but there are obviously other advisory groups in the market. What makes AG2 different and stand out? John? We are not a group that gives stands back, you know, at arms as length, throws us out advice one way and then goes away. Right? We have our boots on the ground with you when we work with you. You know, we're going to slog through issues. We're just going to be there as part of your functional team essentially to get you through the hurdles that you're trying to get through. So we're partners with you throughout this. We're not in a distance. I think that's the first thing that comes to mind mind. Excellent. Any others? Kill your Nick? Oh, well, I would just build on that. I saying that you could think of us as a force multiplier for your team, right? We bring a lot of expertise to bear and we become the virtual extension, you know, of the founders team and the work that they're already doing into all of these other areas that we have experienced with that maybe they don't. Fantastic. Anything else? Nick? Yeah, I think I touched on it earlier this discussion. There are other advisory firms out there. Some focus on tactical or field trials, some are regulatory. They're prominent market research firm in our space. But like I said, there is no one individual that can offer what we're doing. And we as a team don't believe there is a advisory firm focused on what we are laser to focus on, which is providing the glue and the, you know, and the fire for startups to become investor ready. We don't feel that there are any other advisory firms at least that are publicly known to us that are doing this. Like we are in very focused area doing this. And like the John said, we are, we go right in and are part of the team until the job is done. Excellent. Excellent. Well, thank you all very, very much. We'll close it there, but to you guys, our audience, thank you for joining us. Thanks for being here. Thanks for hearing us out. We look forward to working with you. And we all love ag innovation and new technology is coming to fruition. So we love to hear about what you're doing and and explore how we can make it happen.
